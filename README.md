Get reminded of all the relics you have that you tend to forget! 
Never be embarrassed about ending your turn with unceasing top, walking away from a meal ticket trigger that saves 
your life, forgetting whether you've used Hovering Kite, discarding a potion with Sozu, and much more.

The relic reminder mod covers the functionalities of many relics, making sure that you are constantly made aware of 
each of them!

# FAQ

### Why are there no reminders for card-play related relics, such as pen nib, letter opener, and nunchaku? Why are there no reminder for rest-related relics like dream catcher and regal pillow?

For the most part, [Minty](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1812723899) has these cases 
covered. I didn't want to make the mod conflict with Minty, so I avoided adding duplicate features.


### Why are there no block reminders for relics like Orichalcum? 

The [Block Reminder](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1974165911) mod does that, while also 
including metalicise, plated armour, like water, and frost orbs.


### Please add options for enabling/disabling individual relic reminders.

That's a bit too much of a pain, so I won't be adding individual relic options.
