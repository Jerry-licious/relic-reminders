Get reminded of all the relics you have that you tend to forget! Never be embarrassed about ending your turn with unceasing top, walking away from a meal ticket trigger that saves your life, forgetting whether you've used Hovering Kite, discarding a potion with Sozu, and much more.

The relic reminder mod covers the functionalities of many relics, making sure that you are constantly made aware of each of them!

[h1] FAQ [/h1]

[h3] Why are there no reminders for card-play related relics, such as pen nib, letter opener, and nunchaku? Why are there no reminder for rest-related relics like dream catcher and regal pillow? [/h3]

For the most part, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1812723899]Minty[/url] has these cases covered. I didn't want to make the mod conflict with Minty, so I avoided adding duplicate features.


[h3] Why are there no block reminders for relics like Orichalcum? [/h3]

The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1974165911]Block Reminder[/url] mod does that, while also including metalicise, plated armour, like water, and frost orbs.


[h3] Please add options for enabling/disabling individual relic reminders. [/h3]

That's a bit too much of a pain, so I won't be adding individual relic options.

[h3] I have a bug to report! [/h3]
